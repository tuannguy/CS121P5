## Discussion

This project was challenging. But I like it. It made me think and dicover many things.
I had to come to the tutor lab quite often to do this project. However, since this project
was hard, everyone wanted help, and there're not a lot of tutors, I didn't get help with most
of my most puzzling questions. But it turned out, I figured out most of them on my own. And
it's the best feeling in the world! It made me fall in love with Computer Science all over
again. It's really tough sometimes, but it's always rewarding.

## Extra Credit

I did the the key bar. And I just want to add, my checking of the playTime for the
addButton is quite good, even better than the example given program. The given program 
adds a song with an invalid playTime after the user entering it many times. Also, if the
removed song was the currently playing song, I remember to stop it before removing. It's
a little detail but I few many people will not notice it.
